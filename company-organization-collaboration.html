<h2>How can a company or organization collaborate with the lab?</h2>
<p>These are the typical ways to work with us:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You host an MSc student intern from TU Delft for a 10 week engineering
internship.</li>
<li>You sponsor a ~8 month MSc graduation project. &quot;Sponsoring&quot; entails providing
a research problem and ideally co-supervision and access to your resources.</li>
<li>You (co-)sponsor a PhD (4 years, ~65k/yr) or postdoc (1-3 years, ~75k/yr) for
a long term research project. This would typically be tied to a grant
application to find co-funding, see below.</li>
<li>You contribute in-kind or in-cash donations for research grant funding (many
tech research grants require co-financing from companies) and be partners in
the subsequent project which would fund PhD, Postdoc, and MSc projects.</li>
<li>We provide consulting for a fee paid to TU Delft.</li>
<li>We provide pro bono consulting. This is typically minor Q &amp; A as time and
interest permits.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="msc-internship">
<h2>MSc Internship</h2>
<p>3mE students are required to do an internship worth 15 ECs <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[*]</a> (~400 hours, 10
weeks full time) as part of the MSc program. The students should be tasked with
engineering work that ideally aligns with their MSc track, supervised by a
company representative, and integrated into the company/organization for
experience working with others in a professional setting. The internship work
should be distinct from any graduation project work and typically the TU Delft
supervisor is not involved.</p>
<p>The student cannot be employed by the company/organization but may be offered a
student stipend. Dutch companies typically offer 250-350 EUR per month plus
transportation reimbursements, but this is not a requirement.</p>
<p>A TU Delft supervisor (professor) approves the internship and associated
project and assesses a student written report at the end of the internship for
a pass/fail grade for the 15 ECs. The report will be read and stored by the TU
Delft supervisor(s).</p>
<p>The sponsoring company/organization and student should arrange any agreements
between themselves for intellectual property rights and/or non-disclosure
associated with the student's work. Proprietary information should be excluded
from the student's proposal form and their report.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="msc-graduation-project-literature-study-research-or-design-thesis">
<h2>MSc Graduation Project (Literature Study + Research or Design Thesis)</h2>
<p>3mE students are required to do a literature study worth 10 ECs (~270 hours, 7
weeks) and an MSc thesis project worth 35 ECs (~945 hours, 24 weeks). These two
things are typically, and ideally, aligned on the same topic. This research or
design oriented engineering work should be driven by the student under the
primary supervision of the TU Delft supervisor(s).</p>
<p>Companies and organizations can sponsor a graduation project. At the minimum,
you provide a research or design problem for the student to work on under the
supervision of TU Delft supervisor(s). But you can also provide co-supervision
and access to company resources. Providing the later makes for a more enriching
experience. If the project requires resources that TU Delft cannot provide, the
company is expected to provide those resources (travel costs, equipment, etc.).</p>
<p>The company/organization, student, and TU Delft must agree to TU Delft's
standard agreement for graduation projects (see below). You may add additional
terms to the agreement that do not invalidate the standard terms. Any additions
will be reviewed by TU Delft's contract specialists.</p>
