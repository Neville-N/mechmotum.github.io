<h2>Background</h2>
<p>During the spring quarter and summer sessions, we focused on creating a
Kubernetes bare-metal cluster to deploy JupyterHub, BinderHub, and other
services.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtual-machine-cluster">
<h2>Virtual Machine Cluster</h2>
<p>During spring quarter, Kevin and Celine worked on creating the bare metal
Kubernetes cluster. We first created a cluster of virtual machines (VMs) A
Linux test server served as the master node and host machine, while virtual
machines served as the child nodes. We used Vagrant to create these child nodes
and Ansible to provision them.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/metalc/tree/master/dev-env">This folder in our main repository</a> contains
instructions for setting up this development environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bare-metal-cluster">
<h2>Bare-Metal Cluster</h2>
<p>Our original bare-metal cluster consists of one master node named chick0 and 11
children named chick1 through chick10 sequentially. It also contains a
management node called rooster, which acts as a DHCP server, a TFTP server for
NetBoot and a proxy between the Internet and the Kubernetes cluster. The
Kubernetes cluster is under a private network, so the only way to access the
Kubernetes cluster is by connecting through rooster.</p>
<p>The following diagram describes our networking setup.</p>
<img alt="Kubernetes diagram of cluster" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/kubediagram.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>The private network is under the <tt class="docutils literal">10.0.0.0/8</tt>. Kubernetes uses this network
for its resources to communicate.  Rooster has a public IP address of
<tt class="docutils literal">128.120.136.26</tt>, which serves multiple services based on the domain name
entered by the user.</p>
<p>All servers are connected to a smart switch. The ZFS server is also connected
to the switch and provides persistent storage of JupyterHub users' files.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.debian.org/PXEBootInstall#Preface">PXEBoot</a> used a preseed
file and a DHCP server to install Ubuntu Server 18.04 on the servers more
efficiently. Each new server pulls the preseed and installation files via a
TFTP server set up on rooster.</p>
<p>As done in the development environment, the nodes were provisioned using
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/metalc/tree/master/ansible/playbooks">Ansible scripts</a>.
Unlike the development environment, the bare-metal cluster <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;jain.sm/flannel-vs-calico-a-battle-of-l2-vs-l3-based-networking-5a30cd0a3ebd">uses Calico instead
of Flannel</a>
for pod networking. This was chosen because Calico doesn't require software
bridges or IP tunneling like Flannel does. When communicating from pod to pod,
Flannel requires the pod's IP to be &quot;packaged&quot; in another IP (IP tunneling) to
send to the other pod. Calico, on the other hand, uses BGP protocol and
conserves the original pod IP.</p>
<p>When we first setup our bare-metal cluster, we used rooster for our storage
needs by running a NFS server on it. Once we started getting ready for
production, we decided that we needed a more robust and redundant option for
our storage needs. With that in mind, we met with Mike and Dean, folks from the
Bioinformatics Core at the Genome Center here at UC Davis, to discuss the best
storage setup for our needs. After a couple of meetings, we came to the
conclusion that a ZFS setup would make the most sense, this decision was
reached mostly because of factors such as hardware already available and the
experience on ZFS that Dean and Mike brought to the table.</p>
<p>Thanks to a retired ZFS server called the 'Hyperserver', we didn't have to
spend time and money ordering parts for our design. The 'Hyperserver' was quite
fitting of its name as it was a behemoth compared to the other nodes that we
were used to working with. The 'Hyperserver' was a 4U rack with enough slots in
the front to fit 24 drives, and 12 additional slots in the back for more. With
the help of Mike and Dean, we updated the firmware on the motherboard, drives,
and IPMI controller before we installed 24 storage drives in the front, and 2
RAID1 OS drives, 2 zil caches and 2 hot spares in the back. We used 4 stripes
of 6 drives each with raidz2 for our data storage drives, the goal was to
maximize speed and redundancy.  With raidz2, each stripe could lose a maximum
of 2 disks at once and the ZFS would still work. We then hooked up the ZFS to
our smart-switch where the Kubernetes network lives.  We made use of the
10Gib/s intel network card with a short range transceiver and 10M copper wire.
After we finished setting the ZFS server up, we renamed it to 'hen' to go along
with our naming theme for our cluster. Anyone can check out our extensive
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/metalc/blob/master/docs/Bare-Metal/ZFS.md">documentation</a>
for more information regarding how we setup our ZFS.</p>
<p>For security, we mainly followed the guide, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server">How to Secure a Linux Server</a> written by
GitHub user <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/imthenachoman">iamthenachoman</a>. Using the
guide, we implemented SSHing into rooster using only an SSH public/private key
pair, cleaned up short keys and UFW rules, and added intrusion detection for
iptables, SSH, and rootkits. You could find more information on our security
implementation in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/metalc/blob/master/docs/Bare-Metal/baremetal.md#securing-the-cluster">this section</a>
of our documentation.</p>
<p>Later, we added more chicks and upgraded the RAM of almost all chicks. We
increased the number of worker nodes from 10 to 18, and upgraded the RAM on
most chicks from 16GB to 64GB. These efforts prepared the cluster for handling
new classes in the fall quarter.</p>
<p>Our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/metalc/blob/master/docs/Bare-Metal/baremetal.md">documentation</a>
details our setup further and describes the actions taken to build the cluster
from scratch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customizing-jupyterhub">
<h2>Customizing JupyterHub</h2>
<p>We made many modifications to JupyterHub, including redesigning the website,
adding new default environments, and more.</p>
<p>JupyterHub pages is customizable using the <a class="reference external" href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/">Jinja2 templating system</a> .  There are two
ways to add custom HTML files to JupyterHub (as described in <a class="reference external" href="https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/customizing-jupyterhub-on-kubernetes/1769">this Discourse
post</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Through <a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/">InitContainers</a> that
pull repositories of template files before the hub starts,</li>
<li>Or through mounting <a class="reference external" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/">ConfigMaps</a>
to the template file directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose the former option and have repositories for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/jupyterhub-templates">custom HTML files</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/jupyterhub-images">additional images</a>.</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of how the login page looks now.</p>
<img alt="Screenshot of the redesigned JupyterHub login page" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/jupyterhubscreenshot.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>Additionally, more spawner options are included. We modified the default
environment to include many packages requested by professors and students. The
Dockerfile for the default environment is maintained in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/LibreTexts/default-env">this repository</a>.  The environment includes
Python 2 and 3, Octave, R, Julia, and SageMath.  The default environment mainly
installs software and packages via apt and conda for security reasons.</p>
<img alt="Screenshot of the redesigned JupyterHub spawner page" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/jupyterhubspawner.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>The default environment includes Python 2 and 3, Octave, R, Julia, and
SageMath.  Note that SageMath requires Python 2, so changing the Python path
inside the SageMath configuration files is required. <a class="reference external" href="https://bytesofcomputerwisdom.home.blog/2019/03/31/jupyter-notebook-running-the-wrong-python-version/">This article</a>
contains more information on how this was accomplished. This fix is automated
in the Dockerfile.</p>
<p>RStudio is also offered alongside JupyterLab, since deploying web applications
using packages such as <tt class="docutils literal">shiny</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shiny-dashboard</span></tt> require RStudio and do
not run in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interesting-nuggets">
<h2>Interesting Nuggets</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Our Nginx server serves as a proxy to direct packets from public ips to ips
that metallb assigns to services on our cluster. When we setup HTTPS for
JupyterHub, Nginx started complaing as it would try to decrypt the traffic
meant for JupyterHub. We solved the problem by using the stream block, which
streams packet to the backend without trying to decrypt anything.</li>
<li>A service on the cluster can be connected to a ingress controller(for example
Nginx) to make it accessible from outside the cluster. The ingress controller
is not to be confused with the Nginx proxy that we have running outside the
cluster, an ingress controller is a service running on Kubernetes that allows
host or URL based HTTP routing from outside the cluster to services on the
cluster.</li>
<li>cert-manager is a very useful helm chart that can be deployed on Kubernetes
to automatically manage and issue TLS certificates from various issuing
sources. This alongside an ingress controller like Nginx can be a very useful
setup.</li>
<li>Grafana and Prometheus is a good solution for setting up basic monitoring and
alerting on a Kubernetes cluster. They currently have a bug that erases all
the saved data when the Grafana pod is deleted for some reason. A workaround
is to save the json of the dashboards.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future">
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>In the future, we plan to create another cluster including, but not limited, to
the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Having multiple master nodes and using two HAproxy servers instead of a
single Nginx server to avoid single points of failure.</li>
<li>Assigning GPU's to different users.</li>
<li>Assigning different networks based on organization.</li>
</ul>
